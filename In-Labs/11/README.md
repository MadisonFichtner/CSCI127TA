# Lab 11: NumPy arrays

## Logistics

* Due: Thursday, April 5th no later than 11:59 p.m.
* Partner Information: Complete this assignment individually.
* Submission Instructions: Upload your solution, named **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab11.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 11** Dropbox.
* Deadline Reminder: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes

* Gain experience using NumPy arrays to solve problems.

## Background

* In the game of Yahtzee, five six-sided dice are rolled.
* For this assignment, you will simulate a simplified version of Yahtzee.
* In this simplified version of Yahtzee, a **yahtzee** occurs when all five dice show the same number (for example, 3-3-3-3-3).
* In this simplified version of Yahtzee, a **full house** occurs when three dice show one number and two dice show another (for example, 4-4-2-4-2).
* In this simplified version of Yahtzee, a **large straight** occurs when the five numbers can be arranged consecutively from either 1 thru 5 or from 2 thru 6 (for example, 1-3-4-2-5 or 5-2-4-6-3).

## Assignment

* Download [lab11.py][1], rename it according to the instructions above, and make sure you understand it.
* Take the program above and modify it by adding the missing methods such that when the program is run, it might produce [this output][2]. Do not change any of the existing Python code.

## Grading - 10 points
* 3 points - Yahtzees are identified correctly.
* 3 points - Full houses are identified correctly.
* 4 points - Large straights are identified correctly.

## If Time Remains

* Work on Program 5, seeking feedback from your lab assistant if desired.
