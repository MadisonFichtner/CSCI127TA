# CSCI 127, In-Lab 2

## Logistics

* Due: Thursday, January 25th no later than 11:59 p.m.
* Partner Information: Complete this assignment individually.
* Submission Instructions: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab2.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 2** Dropbox.
* Deadline Reminder: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes

* Gain experience writing a Python function.
* Gain experience writing Python selection statements.

## Assignment

* Download [lab2.py][1] and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Modify the program by adding the missing function. The missing function will use Python selection statements to calculate the amount of tax that a single (unmarried) taxpayer owes using the table below. If the missing function is implemented correctly, [this output][2] will appear.

| Rate |  For Single Individuals, Taxable Income Over |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| 10% |  $0 |  
| 12% |  $9,525 |  
| 22% |  $38,700 |  
| 24% |  $82,500 |  
| 32% |  $157,500 |  
| 35% |  $200,000 |  
| 37% |  $500,000 |

## Grading - 10 points
* 7 points - Your program will be tested on seven incomes that are not revealed until after your lab is submitted. For each income where the correct tax is calculated, you will earn 1 point.
* 3 points - A function with the correct name (1 point), correct parameters (1 point) and correct return value (1 point) is used in the solution.

## If Time Remains

Work on Program 1, seeking feedback as necessary. Program 1 is due no later than Friday, January 26th at 11:59 p.m.
