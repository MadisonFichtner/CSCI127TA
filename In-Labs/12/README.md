# Lab 12: matplotlib

## Logistics

* Due: Thursday, April 12th no later than 11:59 p.m.
* Partner Information: Complete this assignment individually.
* Submission Instructions: Upload your solution, named **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab12.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 12** Dropbox.
* Deadline Reminder: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes

* Gain experience with matplotlib to display information.

## Background

* If an initial amount of money is deposited in a bank that pays interest, the future account balance can be calculated using this [Compound Interest Formula][1].
* For this assignment, assume that interest is compounded once per year. In other words, for the formula above, **n** = 1.
* For this assignment, assume that the initial amount deposited is $100 in the year 2018. In other words, **P** = 100.

## Assignment

* Write a python program that is named according to the instructions above. The program should use matplotlib to visualize the impact of a 5% versus a 10% interest rate on an initial deposit of $100.00. The bank account amount should be displayed annually, starting in the year 2018 and ending in the year 2068.
* The program should produce [this graph][2] as closely as possibly.

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - The upper gray bar contains the words _Compound Interest Display for Starting Amount of $100_.
* 1 point - The x-axis is labeled _Year_ and the y-axis is labeled _Dollars_.
* 1 point - The x-axis goes from 2018 to 2068 and the y-axis goes from 0 to 12500.
* 1 point - A box in the upper left part of the graph labels the black plus symbols as _5% interest_ and the blue plus symbols as _10% interest_.
* 2 points - 51 black plus symbols appear in the graph (1 point) and show the correct amounts (1 point).
* 2 points - 51 blue plus symbols appear in the graph (1 point) and show the correct amounts (1 point).
* 2 points - The underlying python code is of high quality and uses functions appropriately to avoid repeated code (all or nothing).

## If Time Remains

* Work on Program 5, seeking feedback from your lab assistant if desired.
