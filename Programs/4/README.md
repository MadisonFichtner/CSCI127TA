# Program 4: Pokédex

## Logistics

* Due Date: Friday, March 23rd no later than 11:59 p.m.
* Partner Information: You may complete this assignment individually or with exactly one partner. If you work with a partner, you **must** both be enrolled in the same lab section or you will both lose 10 points.
* Submission Instructions: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-PartnerFirstName-PartnerLastName-Program4.py** to the BrightSpace **Program 4** Dropbox. If you work with a partner, only one person should submit the solution.
* Deadline Reminder: Once the submission deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes

* To solve this problem, you need to understand the following Python concepts: object-oriented programming and lists.

## Background Information

## Assignment

* Using [pokedex.py][1] as a starting point, supply the missing functions such that interaction with a user could produce this [transcript][2].

## Grading - 100 points
* 20 points. The class **Pokemon** is defined (4 points) with the necessary four methods (4 points each).
* 5 points. The function print_menu is correct.
* 10 points. The function print_pokedex is correct.
